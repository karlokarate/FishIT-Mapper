# Roadmap ideas (post-MVP)

## Recorder upgrades
- richer event capture:
  - redirect detection
  - form submits
  - JS bridge for click tracking (optional)
- better resource classification (mime type, content-type header if available)

## Graph UX upgrades
- interactive graph visualization (force layout / clustering)
- filtering & tagging UI
- graph diff between sessions

## Import
- bundle import (zip) with merge strategies:
  - create new project
  - merge into existing project

## Mapping intelligence
- hub detection + auto-branch suggestions
- canonical URL rules
- endpoint schema inference (params, headers, response keys)

## Tooling
- automated version checks (Gradle Versions Plugin / Renovate)
